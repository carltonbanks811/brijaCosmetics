		<div class="about"><p>As a 20 year old, I founded Brija Cosmetics because I have a passion for using natural and non-toxic skin, hair, body, and makeup products. I decided to start using natural, green products 3 years ago after realizing the effects chemical products have on our health. I want to provide another option for truly natural, mineral makeup.

					<br><br>I go to school full time to complete my degree in English (creative writing) with hopes to work in the publishing field. 					I’m also a Green 			
					Beauty Vlogger on Youtube under the username iluvjesse444. I’m incredibly grateful to be able to share my 					
					knowledge and research with those who 		
					have a passion for natural products as well.
	
					<br><br>Brija Cosmetics features inspired eyeshadow in both single and collection form, lip products, and blushes. I also plan in 					the future to offer other cosmetic products!
	
					<br><b>ALL</b> products are cruelty free and vegan.</p></div>
